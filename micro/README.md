# Syntax file for Micro (Linux/Mac)

## Getting Micro
Information for installing Micro can be found at https://micro-editor.github.io/

## Using Syntax Config 
Navigate to the .config/micro directory on your system (should be in home). Make it if it doesn't exist.

```bash
cd  ~/.config/micro
```
Create a syntax directory if it doesn't already exist.

```bash
mkdir syntax
```
Place the file "echidna.yaml" in this directory. Done.
